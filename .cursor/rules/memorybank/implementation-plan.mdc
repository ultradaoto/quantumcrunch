# Implementation Plan for 'Quantum Crunch'

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for developing the "Quantum Crunch" game, ensuring that each feature is built, tested, and integrated systematically. It references the `progress.mdc` file, where the AI will track completed tasks and milestones. This plan focuses on maintaining the game's core architecture and technology while guiding the development of key gameplay features and multiplayer functionality.

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Game Setup
**Objective**: Establish the foundational Three.js environment with models and scene configuration.

#### Tasks
- Set up the Three.js scene with a `PerspectiveCamera`, `WebGLRenderer`, and basic lighting (`AmbientLight` and `DirectionalLight`).
- Load the CamKII and microtubule models using `GLTFLoader`.
- Position the CamKII and microtubules at predefined coordinates in the scene.

#### Testing
- Confirm that the scene renders correctly with all models visible.
- Ensure the camera provides a clear view of the game area.
- Check for loading errors or performance issues in the console.

**Progress Update**: Upon completion, add a note to `progress.mdc` with the task details and any challenges faced.

---

### Milestone 2: Docking Functionality
**Objective**: Enable the CamKII to dock onto the microtubule surface.

#### Tasks
- Implement collision detection between the CamKII and microtubules.
- Create a docking mechanism that activates when the CamKII is within a specific proximity to a microtubule.
- Add visual feedback (e.g., color change or particle effect) to indicate successful docking.

#### Testing
- Test docking from various angles and positions to ensure accuracy.
- Verify that docking only occurs at valid locations on the microtubule.
- Ensure visual feedback is clear and consistent.

**Progress Update**: Upon completion, update `progress.mdc` with details on the docking implementation and testing results.

---

### Milestone 3: Phosphorous Ion Deposition
**Objective**: Allow the CamKII to deposit phosphorous ions upon docking.

#### Tasks
- Add functionality for the CamKII to deposit a phosphorous ion model when docked.
- Visualize the deposition with an animation or particle effect.
- Ensure each deposition is tracked for the point system.

#### Testing
- Confirm that ions are deposited only when docking is successful.
- Verify that the deposition animation triggers correctly.
- Check that deposited ions remain in place and are visible.

**Progress Update**: Upon completion, log the task in `progress.mdc` with notes on any adjustments made during testing.

---

### Milestone 4: Thread Animation
**Objective**: Animate threads connecting deposited phosphorous ions to represent quantum entanglement.

#### Tasks
- Create semi-transparent thread models that connect deposited ions.
- Animate the threads to visualize superposition and entanglement (e.g., pulsing or glowing effects).
- Ensure threads update dynamically as new ions are deposited.

#### Testing
- Verify that threads connect the correct ions and update in real-time.
- Ensure the animation is smooth and doesn’t impact performance.
- Test with multiple connections to confirm scalability.

**Progress Update**: Upon completion, update `progress.mdc` with details on the animation implementation and performance observations.

---

### Milestone 5: Point System
**Objective**: Implement a scoring system based on ion deposition and connections.

#### Tasks
- Track the number of deposited phosphorous ions.
- Track the number of interconnected microtubules via threads.
- Calculate points based on the distance of connections (longer connections yield more points).
- Display the current score in the game UI.

#### Testing
- Confirm that points are awarded correctly for each action.
- Verify that the score updates in real-time as actions are performed.
- Test edge cases, such as multiple rapid depositions or disconnections.

**Progress Update**: Upon completion, add a note to `progress.mdc` with testing results and any scoring logic adjustments.

---

### Milestone 6: Multiplayer Integration
**Objective**: Enable real-time multiplayer functionality using WebSocket.

#### Tasks
- Set up a WebSocket server to handle client connections and game state synchronization.
- Implement client-side logic to send and receive game actions (e.g., movement, docking, deposition).
- Synchronize player positions, actions, and game states across all connected clients.
- Handle latency with client-side prediction and server reconciliation.

#### Testing
- Test multiplayer interactions with multiple clients in the same game session.
- Verify that actions like docking and deposition are reflected across all clients.
- Ensure that the game remains responsive despite network latency.

**Progress Update**: Upon completion, log the multiplayer integration details in `progress.mdc`, including any challenges with synchronization or latency.

## Progress Tracking

After completing each task or milestone, the AI should update the `progress.mdc` file with the following format:

- **Task Completed**: [Description of the task or milestone]
- **Date**: [Completion date]
- **Notes**: [Challenges, solutions, or additional comments]

This ensures a cumulative record of development progress and helps identify issues early. Regular updates to `progress.mdc` are crucial for maintaining transparency and tracking the game's evolution.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for developing "Quantum Crunch," ensuring that each feature is built and tested systematically. By following these steps and updating the `progress.mdc` file regularly, the AI can maintain focus on the core technology and architecture while progressively building the game’s features. Refer to this document and the adjacent `progress.mdc` file to stay on track and ensure a smooth development process.
