## Starting Point: Initial Code Rewrite for 3D Model Integration

**Current Status**:  
- The game already has some existing code, but an initial rewrite is underway to incorporate 3D imported models.  
- The models being added are:  
  - `camkii.glb`  
  - `microtubule.glb`  
- These models are located in the `src/assets/models/` directory.  
- We are currently focused on rewriting the code to load and integrate these models into the Three.js scene.

**Date**: [Insert Current Date]  
**Notes**:  
- The rewrite is necessary to support the addition of the CamKII and microtubule models.  
- The goal is to ensure these models are properly loaded, positioned, and scaled within the game environment.

**Next Steps**:  
- Finish the code rewrite and confirm successful integration of the 3D models.  
- Test the scene to ensure the models render correctly.
